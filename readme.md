# DAGU Warehouse Robot

This repository contains code used to calibrate, build, and test a warehouse mini robot. The robot will be given an order for three items . It must travel to the correct storage bays, retrieve the items in the correct sequence, and take them to the dispatch bay. This repo forms part of the third year Mechatronics I (MECN3012) students' project at the University of the Witwatersrand.

This specific repository is to help Group A2 track and version our code effectively as the project comes to life. By making this code public we merely intend to share what we learn with fellow Arduino enthusiasts.

**Note: Core functional code, will only be published once the project has been submitted, since this is a public repository. This is to also ensure we comply with all University plagiarism policies.**
